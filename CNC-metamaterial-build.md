CNC-to-Metamaterial Modular Upgrade System

Transform a standard CNC into a bio-design and metamaterial manufacturing platform.

System Overview

This project converts a precision desktop CNC into the world’s first modular metamaterial fabrication system. It supports both traditional machining and next-gen material printing for advanced acoustic, structural, and energy research.
