CNC Build: DIY Bio-Design Machine

A minimum-viable CNC platform built from scratch using frugal components and open-source control systems — designed for precision bio-shape cutting, prototyping, and future metamaterial upgrades.

⸻

 Build Options

 Option A: Proof-of-Concept Prototype

Garage-friendly build using common parts:
	•	Linear rails: Drawer slides (sufficient for foam/wood)
	•	Motion: NEMA 17 stepper motors from 3D printer community
	•	Drive system: Threaded rod + nuts as DIY lead screws
	•	Controller: Arduino + GRBL (most affordable)
	•	Spindle: Handheld router (DeWalt or similar)

Frame Materials:
	•	8020-style aluminum extrusion
	•	Plywood base (rigid enough for light cuts)
	•	Skateboard bearings for low-cost linear support

Code Stack:
	•	GRBL firmware (Arduino-based)
	•	Universal G-Code Sender (host software)
	•	FreeCAD / Fusion360 (CAM design & toolpath gen)

Proof target: Cut a recognizable bio-shape (leaf, curve, wing) from foam.

Goal: Show that even with low-cost parts, CNC precision surpasses hand tools.

⸻

 Option B: Precision Build (Preferred)

Foundation-ready with precision motion hardware:
	•	Frame: Bolted 8080/8040 extrusion
	•	Motion System: HGR linear guides + 1605/1204 ball screws
	•	Control: LinuxCNC from day one (industrial-grade precision)
	•	Spindle: Palm router (modular mount, upgradeable)

Why This Route?
	•	No waste on throwaway parts
	•	Learn true CNC motion control immediately
	•	Upgrade-ready frame and motion for future additions
	•	All precision components reused later

Spindle Setup
	•	Tool Mount: Adjustable router clamp
	•	Initial Spindle: Palm router (e.g., DeWalt DWP611)
	•	Upgrade Path: ISO30 ATC spindle (Phase 2)

⸻

 Assembly Strategy
	1.	Flat Base First: Guarantees square, level geometry
	2.	Vertical Structure: Z-axis support, gantry install
	3.	Precision Rail Mounting: Align linear guides with care
	4.	Motion System Install: Ball screws, couplings, test motion
	5.	Router Mount & Control: Electronics integration + motion testing

⸻

 Budget Target
	•	Low-cost proof system: ~$300–600 (GRBL build)
	•	Precision upgrade version: ~$1,800–2,500 depending on source

⸻

 Why Bolted Extrusion?
	•	Modular and mistake-friendly
	•	Supports precision shimming/squaring
	•	Reusable in future steel frame upgrades
	•	Excellent for learning hands-on CNC assembly

| Component        | Spec           | Notes              |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| NEMA 23 Stepper  | 3Nm torque     | Use on all axes     |
| Linear Rail      | HGR20 x 1500mm | Y-axis precision    |

How to Modify
	1.	Keep the pipe (|) characters lined up — each one separates a column.
	2.	Use dashes (---) under the headers to define a table structure.
	3.	Spaces are optional but help readability.
	4.	If unsure, paste the table into a Markdown editor (like Dillinger or GitHub preview) to check formatting.

 Tip for Mobile Contributors:
	•	Use a monospace notes app or paste into GitHub’s mobile web editor for easier column alignment.
	•	Even if your table is a little misaligned, GitHub will still render it properly as long as the pipes (|) are in place.***
